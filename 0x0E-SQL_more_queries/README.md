Have learnt how to use the MySQL GRANT statement to grant privileges to user accounts.
JOIN is one of the most important SQL queries and itâ€™s frequently used across any relational databases.JOIN is a clause used in SQL to link data from one table to another table using one or more data column shared between two tables.
In other words, we combine data of the two existing tables into one. For example, table1 has data about x and y, table2 has data about y and z,
so we join table1 and table2 to get a table3 with all data of x, y, and z.
 There are seven join types:
INNER JOIN
FULL [OUTER] JOIN
FULL [OUTER] JOIN without the intersection
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN without the intersection
RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN
RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN without the intersection
